## Tech Stack

- **Swift and SwiftUI**: The foundation of the app, Swift and SwiftUI provided a robust and modern development environment, making the coding process efficient and enjoyable.
- **The Composable Architecture (TCA)**: [TCA](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) served as the backbone of the app, offering a predictable and scalable state management system that simplified code organization and facilitated comprehensive testing. Each feature (reducer) in project is thoroughly tested using TCA's [TestStore](https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/documentation/composablearchitecture/testing), ensuring the reliability and stability of our app.
- **Core Data**: Leveraging Core Data ensured reliable local data persistence, allowing users to access their information seamlessly and consistently.
- **StoreKit2**: StoreKit2 streamlined the management of in-app purchases, providing a secure and user-friendly experience for monetization within the app.
- **WidgetKit**: WidgetKit enhanced the user experience by allowing users to interact with the app directly from their device's home screen, providing quick access to important information.
- **CloudKit**: CloudKit facilitated robust cloud storage and synchronization, enabling seamless data management across devices while maintaining data integrity and security.
- **iPad Compatibility**: The app was optimized for iPad, taking advantage of the larger screen size and delivering an enhanced experience tailored to the device.
- **Secure Analytics**: TelemetryDeck was incorporated to gather valuable insights into user behavior while ensuring the privacy and security of user data. This data-driven approach helped improve the app while maintaining a strong focus on user privacy.
